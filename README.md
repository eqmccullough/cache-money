## User Story

As a functioning adult, I would like to have a simple and healthy relationship with my money through a simple budgeting app tool. When I load the application I will be able to signup/login to my account. Then I will be able to see my latest expenses. When I scroll over the donut chart I can see total expenses per category. Then I can see if my current spending is within my budget goals. When I click on the category menu I see the list of categories I'm tracking. Then I can click on the category I would like to edit. When I click on a specific category, I can see all the items I am tracking. Then I can add, update or delete the expense items in that category.
